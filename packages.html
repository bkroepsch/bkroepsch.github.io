  <ol>
    <li><strong>Schedule Meetings</strong><br>
      After you have signed up for an Aria Package, your assigned primary coach will contact you to schedule your first meeting. Once you and your coach agree on a meeting date and time, your counselor will send you a meeting invitation and access to your <span class="highlight">[Coaching Portal / CoachAccountable?]</span> with all of your materials and templates.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Meet with Coach</strong><br>
      Coaching sessions are 1 hour long and are conducted via Zoom/MS Teams. Our coaching program is set up to meet weekly to stay on schedule, but we know you are busy and we are able to accommodate your schedule. During the coaching session your coach will guide you through the program, answer questions, and review the agenda while taking detailed notes <span class="highlight">[ai note generator like blue print?]</span> which will be shared with you.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Complete Tasks</strong><br>
      After your meeting, your coach will send you a list of tasks to accomplish before the next coaching session. In the meantime, you should be working diligently to complete the tasks. Be sure to constantly communicate with your coach about status of your tasks. Email your coach if you'd like them to review any materials you've been working on!
