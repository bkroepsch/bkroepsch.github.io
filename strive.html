  <h3>Program Structure</h3>
  <p>You might be wondering: what's the difference between starting retirement strive at 50 or 60? We know that every retiree's story, retirement goals, and retirement needs are different, and while we don't want to be too prescriptive, here is a broad overview of how we approach each retiree.</p>

  <h3>How Our Retirement Strive Program Works</h3>
  <p>In Retirement Strive, you'll meet once a month via Zoom/Teams one-on-one with your designated coach to brainstorm, strategize and prioritize what to accomplish for the month. Between meetings, you and your coach will communicate to check in on how you are doing. We're here 24/7 via email to support you.</p>

  <h3>Monthly Meetings</h3>
  <p>You and your assigned coach will meet once a month via Zoom/Teams for 1 hour. During the meeting, you and your counselor will discuss in detail your goals, expectations, and any concerns you have currently and for the upcoming year.</p>

  <h3>Weekly Check-Ins</h3>
  <p>Immediately after your meeting, your coach will set some objectives to accomplish before the next meeting. Your coach will also check in with you via email to see how you are progressing, answer any questions, address any issues and concerns, and, most importantly, how you are doing.</p>

  <h3>Here to Help!</h3>
  <p>Even though you meet with your coach monthly, your coach is available 24/7 via email. At any time, you can ask questions or for feedback. Your coach can help research interests, hobbies, and guide building friendships.</p>
